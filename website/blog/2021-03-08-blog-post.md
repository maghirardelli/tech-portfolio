title: WiCS Tech Portfolio Workshop
---

Using the tech portfolio I learned about during Virtual Grace Hopper Celebration 2020, I introduced the Davidson College Women in Computer Science (WiCS) club to GitPages, Markdown, and Git Actions! We used the fantastic template found [here](https://github.com/joatmon08/tech-portfolio).
